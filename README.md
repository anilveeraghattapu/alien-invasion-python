# ðŸ‘¾ Alien Invasion - A Python Game

## ðŸŽ® Introduction  
*Alien Invasion* is a classic arcade-style shooting game built using **Python** and **Pygame**. The player controls a spaceship and must shoot down waves of aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen. As the game progresses, the difficulty increases, making it more challenging and fun!

This project is based on the **"Alien Invasion"** game from the book *Python Crash Course* by **Eric Matthes**. All credit for the original game concept and implementation goes to the author. This version may include modifications and improvements for learning and customization.
